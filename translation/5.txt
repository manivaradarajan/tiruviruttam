The northern wind always so cool
At this moment in this place
Has cast away its nature and
Only blows fire.

Seeking his cool radiant tulasi
Her wide eyes stream like the
Downpour of a cloud in a storm.

Was this all to make her pale?
The sceptre of the one who is
Like a cool rainclould
Seems to have today bent.
