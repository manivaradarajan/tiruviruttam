When it sees them who are his shadow
  the demure maiden of the cowherd clan
  the Lady of the Earth
  Sri herself

Will my heart stay there or run back?

Alone it went 
Chasing after that fiery furious eagle
Who carries the Lord cherished by the eternals
  with tulasi garland cool and sweet
  and discus flaming hot.
