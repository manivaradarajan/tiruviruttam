Seeing them who are one with him -- his shadow --
  the demure maiden of the flute-playing cowherds
  the Lady of the Earth
  Sri herself

Will my heart stay there or will it run back?

Alone it went chasing after that fiery furious Bird
Who bears the Lord cherished by the eternals
Whose tulasi garland cool and sweet
Burns like the discus flaming hot.
