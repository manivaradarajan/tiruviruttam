When it sees them who are in his shadow
  the demure maiden of the cowherd clan
  the Lady of the Earth
  Sri herself

Will my heart stay there or run back?

Alone it went
Chasing after that fiery furious eagle
Who carries the Lord
Cherished by the eternals
  his tulasi garland cool and sweet
  his discus flaming hot.
