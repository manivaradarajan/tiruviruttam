My only heart was stolen by that Great Bird of his

So no more heart do I have
For his sweet tulasi to beguile.

O cool breeze, you are poison!

Wafting the fragrance of the tulasi wreath
    ringing the head of him
    who drank the breast of the mad cunning sorceress
You make my very life shiver.

Is this right?
