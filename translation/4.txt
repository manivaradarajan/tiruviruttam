My one heart was stolen by that Great Bird of his

So I have no heart now
For his sweet tulasi to beguile.

O cool breeze, you are poison!
You make my very life shiver.

You thrusting yourself here 
Wafting tulasi that garlanded his head 
Who drank the breast of the mad cunning sorceress.

Is this proper?
