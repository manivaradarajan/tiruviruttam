My one heart was stolen by that Great Bird of his

So I have no heart now
For his sweet tulasi to beguile.

O cool breeze, you are poison!
You thrust yourself here 
    wafting tulasi that
    wreathed the head of him
    who drank the breast of the mad cunning sorceress
You make my very life shiver.

Is this proper?
