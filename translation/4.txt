My only heart was stolen by that Great Bird of his

So no more heart do I have
For his sweet tulasi to beguile.

O cool breeze, you are poison!
You thrust yourself here 
    bearing tulasi that
    wreathed the head of him
    who drank the breast of the mad cunning sorceress
Making my very life shiver.

So this is your nature?
