Seeing them who are like his shadows
  the demure maiden of the flute-playing cowherds
  the Lady of the Earth
  Sri herself

Will my heart loiter there or will it fly back?

Alone it went
Chasing after that fiery furious Bird
  who bears the Lord cherished by the eternals
    whose tulasi garland cool and sweet
      burns like the discus flaming hot.
