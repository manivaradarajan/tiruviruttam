Seeing Them who are like my Beloved's shadows
  the demure maiden of the flute-playing cowherds
  the Lady of the Earth
  Sri herself

Will my heart stay there eternally? 
Will it come back and continue the suffering?

(Seeing)
My Beloved, adorning the cool and beautiful tulasi garland
And the flaming hot discus too
Carried away by that fiery furious Garuda
Worshipped by the eternals

Helplessly, my heart followed that bird
