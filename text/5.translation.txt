The northern wind always so cool
  at this moment
  in this place
Has cast away its nature and
Just blows fire.

Seeking his cool radiant tulasi
Her wide eyes stream 
Like torrential rain from a cloud.

Was this all to steal her color?

His sceptre 
  he who who is like a cool rainclould
Seems to have today bent.
