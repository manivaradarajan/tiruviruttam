The northern wind always so cool
At this moment in this place
Has cast away its nature and
Only blows fire.

Seeking his cool radiant tulasi
Her wide eyes stream like the
Downpour of a cloud in a storm.

Did He send the breeze only to take her colour away?

The sceptre of the one who is
Like a cool rainclould
Seems to have today bent.
