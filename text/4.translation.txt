My one heart was stolen by that Great Bird of his.

So without heart I am
For his sweet tulasi to beguile.

O chilly pernicious breeze!

You thrust yourself here
  wafting tulasi that wreathed his head
    he who suckled the breast of the vengeful cunning sorceress.

Is it your nature to make my very soul shiver?
