My one suffering heart was stolen by the Great Bird of That Person
For his sweet beautiful tulasi to beguile, my heart
I dont have anymore

O deadly cold wind!
Meanwhile, you thrust yourself here
Wafting the fragrance of tulasi that adorned my Beloved's head
He who suckled the breast of the vengeful cunning sorceress.

Is it your nature
To make my very soul shiver?
