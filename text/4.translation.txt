My one heart was stolen by that Great Bird of his
So I have no heart now
For his sweet tulasi to beguile.

O deadly cool breeze!

You thrust yourself here
Wafting tulasi that garlanded his head
He who suckled the breast of the vengeful cunning sorceress.

Is it your nature
To make my very soul shiver?
